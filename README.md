# Clean & Combine all PDF files in the current directory

Cleaning a pdf in this case means removing unnecessary pages - if one page is spread over multiple, adding text one line at a time, or something like that.

# Usage

Copy the `.py` script to the directory containing the pdf files you want to clean and combine. Then run the it inside. It will first locate all pdf files and list them.

```bash
$ python clean&combine_pdf.py
```
